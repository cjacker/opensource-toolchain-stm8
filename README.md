# Opensource toolchain for STM8

**NOTE, most of works of STM8 development with Linux was done by Georg Icking-Konert, 
for example, stm8gal flashing tool, SPL patches for SDCC and opensource sdk STM8_headers, please refer to https://github.com/gicking** 

ST's 8-bit microcontroller platform is implemented around a high-performance 8-bit core and a state-of-the-art set of peripherals. This platform is manufactured using an ST-proprietary 130 nm embedded non-volatile memory technology.
The STM8 allows fast and safe development through enhanced stack pointer operations, advanced addressing modes and new instructions.

For more infomation, refer to https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm8-8-bit-mcus.html

# Hardware requirements
You need:
* a development board with STM8 MCU.
* a STLINK USB adapter(no matter version) with SWIM interface, for flashing and debugging.
* a USB/UART adapter if it is no one on development board. it can be used for UART flashing/programming with bootloader support, but lack of debugging support.

# Toolchain overview

The opensource toolchain for STM8 under linux consist of:
* SDCC as compiler
* stm8flash, flashing with STLINK adapter
* stm8gal, flashing with USB/UART adapter
* openocd/stm8-binutils-gdb, as debugger, a STLINK adapter is mandary.

# SDCC Compiler
Most Linux distributions shipped SDCC in their repositories. You can install it by yum or apt.

If you really want to build it yourself, at least you need make/bison/flex/libtool/g++/boost development package/zlib development package/etc. installed, and the building process is really simple:
```
./configure --prefix=<where you want to install SDCC>
make
make install
```
if the `prefix` does not set to standard dir (such as '/usr' or '/usr/local'), you need add the `<prefix>/bin` dir to PATH env.

# OpenOCD

Most Linux dist ships OpenOCD package, you can install it by yum or apt.

For STM8 development, it's not neccesary to patch and build OpenOCD yourself.

If you really want to build it, please refer to "OpenOCD for Programming and Debugging" section of ![Opensource toolchain for gd32vf103](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-gd32vf103).

# SDK
## Baremetal
"Baremetal programming" is not that difficult for MCU, you can always do something without using any libraries/SDKs.

Here is an example to blink a LED wired up as PD0->Resister->LED->GND.

You must read the [datasheet](https://www.alldatasheet.com/view.jsp?Searchword=STM8S208MB) first to find out the memory and register map, here I use STM8S208MB and the io register map as below:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1625340/156101703-486034e5-f086-4f96-925f-3e35a1e5a943.png" width="50%"/>

These registers are pretty much self-explanatory. hereâ€™s a brief overview: `DDR` is the direction register, which configures a pin as either an input or an output. After we configured `DDR` we can use `ODR` for writing or `IDR` for reading pin state. Control registers `CR1` and `CR2` are used for configuring internal pull-ups, output speed and selecting between push-pull or pseudo open-drain.

```
//blink.c

#include <stdint.h>
#define _SFR_(mem_addr)     (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x5000 + (mem_addr)))
/* PORT D */
#define PD_ODR      _SFR_(0x0F)
#define PD_DDR      _SFR_(0x11)
#define PD_CR1      _SFR_(0x12)

/* CLOCK */
#define CLK         _SFR_(0xc6)

#define LED_PIN     0


#define F_CPU 16000000UL //16Mhz
static inline void delay_ms(uint16_t ms) {
    uint32_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < ((F_CPU / 18000UL) * ms); i++)
        __asm__("nop");
}

void main() {
    CLK = 0x00; // switch to 16Mhz

    PD_DDR |= (1 << LED_PIN); // configure PD0 as output
    PD_CR1 |= (1 << LED_PIN); // push-pull mode
    while (1) {
        /* toggle pin every 1000ms */
        PD_ODR ^= (1 << LED_PIN);
        delay_ms(1000);
    }
}
```

and built it:

```
sdcc -lstm8 -mstm8 blink.c
```

## SPL - ST's official Standard Peripheral Library

ST officially provide 'STM8 Standard Peripheral Library' for STM8 MCUs, you can download it from [here](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/search.html#q=STM8%20Standard%20Peripheral%20Library-t=tools-page=1)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1625340/156116884-ab592ccc-176a-4d1a-a678-8c5786d1f902.png" width="40%"/>


**NOTE:**
* **you have to sign up and sign in, and there is also a license need to read and agree before download**
* **There are 4 packages, choose the correct one according to your MCU model**

According to ST's license, it seems this SPLs can be redistributed with original license kept.

As metioned beginning, Georg Icking-Konert done a great job to provide a set of patches to enable SPL work with SDCC.

Please refer to https://github.com/gicking/STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch and patch the SPL yourself after download.

[Here](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-stm8/tree/main/blink-SPL) provide a blink example for SPL.

for STM8S208MB, you should download 'en.stsw-stm8069_v2.3.1.zip'

```
git clone https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-stm8.git
cd opensource-toolchain-stm8
cp en.stsw-stm8069_v2.3.1.zip .
unzip en.stsw-stm8069_v2.3.1.zip
git clone https://github.com/gicking/STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch.git
cat STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch/STM8S_StdPeriph_Lib_V2.3.1_sdcc.patch |patch -p1
cd blink-SPL
make
```

After blink-SPL example building successfully, you will get 'blink.ihx' and various other files in example dir.

## STM8_headers
Georg Icking-Konert also had another great opensource project named ["STM8_headers"](https://github.com/gicking/STM8_headers) for all STM8 microcontroller series, namely STM8A, STM8S, STM8L, STM8AF and STM8AL. it's MIT license and you can use this project instead of SPL.

for example, blink.c using STM8_headers:
```
//blink.c using STM8_headers

#include "STM8S208MB.h"
#define LED_PORT   sfr_PORTD
#define LED_PIN    PIN0

// toggle specified pin. Pass port struct as pointer
void toggle_pin(PORT_t *port, uint8_t pin) {

  port->ODR.byte ^= pin;

} // toggle_pin

void main (void) {
  uint32_t  i;
  // switch to 16MHz (default is 2MHz)
  sfr_CLK.CKDIVR.byte = 0x00;
  // configure LED pin as output
  LED_PORT.DDR.byte = LED_PIN;    // input(=0) or output(=1)
  LED_PORT.CR1.byte = LED_PIN;    // input: 0=float, 1=pull-up; output: 0=open-drain, 1=push-pull
  LED_PORT.CR2.byte = LED_PIN;    // input: 0=no exint, 1=exint; output: 0=2MHz slope, 1=10MHz slope
  // main loop
  while(1) {
    // toggle LED. Pass port struct as pointer
    toggle_pin(&LED_PORT, LED_PIN);
    // simple wait ~1000ms @ 16MHz
    for (i=0; i<600000L; i++)
      NOP();
  } // main loop
} // main
```

[Here](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-stm8/tree/main/blink-STM8_headers) provide a blink example for STM8_headers:
```
git clone https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-stm8.git
cd opensource-toolchain-stm8
git clone https://github.com/gicking/STM8_headers.git
cd blink-STM8_headers
make
```
After blink-STM8_headers example building successfully, you will get 'blink.ihx' and various other files in example dir.

# Flashing/Programming
There are two flashing tools for STM8 can be used with linux, stm8flash works with STLINK and stm8gal works with UART.

It may be a little bit weird, but you should know that if you want to enable UART flashing:
* You have to use a STLINK adapter and stm8flash to flash a special firmware first.
* Or you have an empty development board never flashed with STLINK.

## Flashing with STLINK adapter
First, please connect the corresponding pins of SWIM interface and development board.

You need gcc/libusb development packages installed before build and install stm8flash:

Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash.git 
cd stm8flash
make
sudo install -m0755 stm8flash /usr/bin/
```

After everything wired up, for instance, here use baremetal blink.c as example:

```
sdcc -lstm8 -mstm8 blink.c
sudo stm8flash -cstlinkv2 -pstm8s208mb -w blink.ihx
```

or you can try some examples within this repo:

```
make
make swim
```

Run `stm8flash --help` to get more usage tips.

## Flashing with UART (no debugging support)

### How to enable bootloader
As mentioned above, a STLINK adapter is mandary to enable UART flashing support. acctually, we need STLINK adapter and stm8flash to change some 'option bytes' of STM8 MCU to enable the 'bootloader' (BSL). Please refer to [UM0560 "STM8 bootloader user manual"](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/cd00201192-stm8-bootloader-stmicroelectronics.pdf) and corresponding datasheet of the MCU you use for more infomation.

Not all STM8 models have a bootloader, the support list as below (from UM0560):
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1625340/156280459-aabdcd6a-39e9-4806-9bb3-689c06a71933.png" width="60%"/>

Option bytes of STM8S208MB (from STM8S208MB datasheet):
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1625340/156280543-c6d7b658-7653-43b1-bc04-f9964648bc7c.png" width="60%"/>

What we need to enable bootloader is:

```
set 0x487E to 0x55
set 0x487F to 0xAA
```

There is various way to accomplish this, the STVP for windows officially provide by ST have option bytes configuration support, but as I know, it only set 0x487E and can not set 0x487F.

For linux, there is no STVP provided. Here we use another way: flash a firmware to set these optionbytes with STLINK. after that, the UART flashing can be used until you flash this development board with STLINK again.

There are BSL activate codes in stm8gal repo, you need to build it yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/gicking/stm8gal.git
cd BSL_activate
make DEVICE=STM8S207 # suitable for STM8S208MB
```

by the way, If you use STM8S105, you should:
```
make DEVICE=STM8S105
```

After building successfully, "STM8S207/main.ihx" will be generated.

```
sudo stm8flash -cstlinkv2 -pstm8s208mb -w STM8S207/main.ihx
```

This firmware will set the requires option bytes, also blink the LED on board. by default, it blink PH2 for STM8S207 and PD0 for STM8S105, you can modify the codes according to your development board.

### stm8gal
After bootloader enabled, we can use stm8gal and UART to flash the development board wired up with a USB cable.

stm8gal is a tool for uplading hexfiles to the STM8 microcontroller via UART or SPI , using the built-in ROM bootloader. 

```
git clone https://github.com/gicking/stm8gal.git
make
sudo install -m0755 stm8gal /usr/bin
```
For usage:
```
stm8gal --help
```

For flashing:
```
sudo stm8gal -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -w blink.ihx -reset 0
```

when it prompt for 'synchronize', press the RESET button once on your development board:
```
stm8gal (v1.5.0)
  open serial port '/dev/ttyUSB0' ... done
  synchronize ... done (ACK)
  get device info ... done (STM8S; 128kB flash)
  load 'blink.ihx' ... done
  convert IHX ... done
  write 219B / 219B ... done
  read 219B / 219B ... done
  verify memory ... done
  jump to 0x8000 ... done
done with program
```

**NOTE, as mentioned above, if you use STLINK adapter flashing the board again, you may need to re-activate the bootloader.**

# Debugging with stm8-gdb/OpenOCD

## OpenOCD connection

A STLINK adapter and OpenOCD are mandary for debugging.

Within this repo, a OpenOCD interface cfg 'stlink.cfg' is provided for various known STLINK versions. 

Before continue reading, please wire up the STLINK adapter and development board, and try launch a terminal and run:
```
openocd -f st-link.cfg -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm8s.cfg -c "init" -c "reset halt"
```
Here is the console output:
```

## Install stm8-gdb
[stm8-binutils-gdb](https://stm8-binutils-gdb.sourceforge.io/) project implement the opensource GDB debugger for STM8.

Up to this tutorial written, the latest version is '2021-07-18', follow below instructions to build and install it, it will download binutils/gdb tarball automatically from upstream:

```
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm8-binutils-gdb/files/stm8-binutils-gdb-sources-2021-07-18.tar.gz/download -O
stm8-binutils-gdb-sources-2021-07-18.tar.gz
tar -xf stm8-binutils-gdb-sources-2021-07-18.tar.gz
cd stm8-binutils-gdb-sources
./patch_binutils.sh
./configure_binutils.sh
cd binutils-2.30
make
sudo make install
```

## Enable debug build

stm8-gdb use ELF binary format with debug symbols, you have to use below flags to build your source code:
```
--out-fmt-elf --all-callee-saves --debug --verbose --stack-auto --fverbose-asm  --float-reent --no-peep
```

For instance:
```
sdcc -lstm8 -mstm8 --out-fmt-elf --all-callee-saves --debug --verbose --stack-auto --fverbose-asm  --float-reent --no-peep blink.c
```

After compilation, a `blink.elf` will be generated. you can try `make debug` in 'blink-baremetal' example.

**NOTE:** If you have multiple source files in your project, these flags should be applied to every source file when creating object code. otherwise, the final ELF binary will not have debug symbols embeded in.


## Debug
After blink.elf with debug symbols built, with openocd connected, launch 2nd terminal and try:
```
stm8-gdb -q blink.elf
```
A gdb sesscion will be opened:
```
