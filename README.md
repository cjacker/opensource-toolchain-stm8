# Opensource toolchain for STM8

**NOTE, most of works of STM8 development with Linux was done by Georg Icking-Konert, 
for example, stm8gal flashing tool, SPL patches for SDCC and opensource sdk STM8_headers, please refer to https://github.com/gicking** 

ST's 8-bit microcontroller platform is implemented around a high-performance 8-bit core and a state-of-the-art set of peripherals. This platform is manufactured using an ST-proprietary 130 nm embedded non-volatile memory technology.
The STM8 allows fast and safe development through enhanced stack pointer operations, advanced addressing modes and new instructions.

# Hardware requirements
You need:
* a development board with STM8 MCU.
* a STLINK USB adapter(no matter version) with SWIM interface, for flashing and debugging.
* a USB/UART adapter if it is not on development board. it can be used for UART flashing/programming if with bootloader support, but lack of debugging support.

# Toolchain overview

The opensource toolchain for STM8 under linux consist of:
* SDCC as compiler
* stm8flash, flashing with STLINK adapter
* stm8gal, flashing with USB/UART adapter
* openocd/stm8-binutils-gdb, as debugger, a STLINK adapter is mandary.

# SDCC Compiler
Most Linux distributions shipped SDCC in their repositories. You can install it by yum or apt.

If you really want to build it yourself, at least you need make/bison/flex/libtool/g++/boost development package/zlib development package/etc. installed, and the building process is really simple:
```
./configure --prefix=<where you want to install SDCC>
make
make install
```
if the `prefix` does not set to standard dir (such as '/usr' or '/usr/local'), you need add the `<prefix>/bin` dir to PATH env.

# OpenOCD

Most Linux dist ships OpenOCD package, you can install it by yum or apt.

For STM8 development, it's not neccesary to patch and build OpenOCD yourself.

If you really want to build it, please refer to "OpenOCD for Programming and Debugging" section of ![Opensource toolchain for gd32vf103](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-gd32vf103).

# SDK
## Baremetal
"Baremetal programming" is not that difficult for MCU, you can always do something without using any libraries/SDKs.

Here is an example to blink a LED wired up as PD0->Resister->LED->GND.

You must read the [datasheet](https://www.alldatasheet.com/view.jsp?Searchword=STM8S208MB) first to find out the memory and register map, here I use STM8S208MB and the io register map as below:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1625340/156101703-486034e5-f086-4f96-925f-3e35a1e5a943.png" width="50%"/>

These registers are pretty much self-explanatory. hereâ€™s a brief overview: `DDR` is the direction register, which configures a pin as either an input or an output. After we configured `DDR` we can use `ODR` for writing or `IDR` for reading pin state. Control registers `CR1` and `CR2` are used for configuring internal pull-ups, output speed and selecting between push-pull or pseudo open-drain.

```
//blink.c

#include <stdint.h>
#define _SFR_(mem_addr)     (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x5000 + (mem_addr)))
/* PORT D */
#define PD_ODR      _SFR_(0x0F)
#define PD_DDR      _SFR_(0x11)
#define PD_CR1      _SFR_(0x12)

/* CLOCK */
#define CLK         _SFR_(0xc6)

#define LED_PIN     0


#define F_CPU 16000000UL //16Mhz
static inline void delay_ms(uint16_t ms) {
    uint32_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < ((F_CPU / 18000UL) * ms); i++)
        __asm__("nop");
}

void main() {
    CLK = 0x00; // switch to 16Mhz

    PD_DDR |= (1 << LED_PIN); // configure PD0 as output
    PD_CR1 |= (1 << LED_PIN); // push-pull mode
    while (1) {
        /* toggle pin every 1000ms */
        PD_ODR ^= (1 << LED_PIN);
        delay_ms(1000);
    }
}
```

and built it:

```
sdcc -lstm8 -mstm8 blink.c
```

## SPL - ST's official Standard Peripheral Library

ST officially provide 'STM8 Standard Peripheral Library' for STM8 MCUs, you can download it from [here](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/search.html#q=STM8%20Standard%20Peripheral%20Library-t=tools-page=1)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1625340/156116884-ab592ccc-176a-4d1a-a678-8c5786d1f902.png" width="40%"/>


**NOTE:**
* **you have to sign up and sign in, and there is also a license need to read and agree before download**
* **There are 4 packages, choose the correct one according to your MCU model**

According to ST's license, it seems this SPLs can be redistributed with original license kept.

As metioned beginning, Georg Icking-Konert done a great job to provide a set of patches to enable SPL work with SDCC.

Please refer to https://github.com/gicking/STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch and patch the SPL yourself after download.

[Here](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-stm8/tree/main/blink-SPL) provide a blink example for SPL.

for STM8S208MB, you should download 'en.stsw-stm8069_v2.3.1.zip'

```
git clone https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-stm8.git
cd opensource-toolchain-stm8
# download 'en.stsw-stm8069_v2.3.1.zip'
unzip en.stsw-stm8069_v2.3.1.zip
git clone https://github.com/gicking/STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch.git
cat STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch/STM8S_StdPeriph_Lib_V2.3.1_sdcc.patch |patch -p1
cd blink-SPL
make
```

## STM8_headers
Georg Icking-Konert also had another great opensource project named ["STM8_headers"](https://github.com/gicking/STM8_headers) for all STM8 microcontroller series, namely STM8A, STM8S, STM8L, STM8AF and STM8AL. it's MIT license and you can use this project instead of SPL.

for example, blink.c using STM8_headers:
```
//blink.c using STM8_headers

#include "STM8S208MB.h"
#define LED_PORT   sfr_PORTD
#define LED_PIN    PIN0

// toggle specified pin. Pass port struct as pointer
void toggle_pin(PORT_t *port, uint8_t pin) {

  port->ODR.byte ^= pin;

} // toggle_pin

void main (void) {
  uint32_t  i;
  // switch to 16MHz (default is 2MHz)
  sfr_CLK.CKDIVR.byte = 0x00;
  // configure LED pin as output
  LED_PORT.DDR.byte = LED_PIN;    // input(=0) or output(=1)
  LED_PORT.CR1.byte = LED_PIN;    // input: 0=float, 1=pull-up; output: 0=open-drain, 1=push-pull
  LED_PORT.CR2.byte = LED_PIN;    // input: 0=no exint, 1=exint; output: 0=2MHz slope, 1=10MHz slope
  // main loop
  while(1) {
    // toggle LED. Pass port struct as pointer
    toggle_pin(&LED_PORT, LED_PIN);
    // simple wait ~1000ms @ 16MHz
    for (i=0; i<600000L; i++)
      NOP();
  } // main loop
} // main
```

[Here](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-stm8/tree/main/blink-STM8_headers) provide a blink example for STM8_headers:
```
git clone https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-stm8.git
cd opensource-toolchain-stm8
git clone https://github.com/gicking/STM8_headers.git
cd blink-STM8_headers
make
```

# Flashing/Programming
There are two flashing tools for STM8 you can use with linux, stm8flash works with STLINK and stm8gal works with UART.

It may be a little bit weird, but you should understand, If you want to enable UART flashing support:
* You have to use a STLINK adapter and stm8flash to flash a special firmware first
* Or you have an empty development board never flashed with STLINK

## Flashing with STLINK adapter
You can use STLINK SWIM interface to wire up STM8 development board to PC linux, the PROS is it supports flashing and debugging, the CONS is you have to buy a STLINK adapter and wire it up. But as mentioned above, a STLINK adapter and stm8flash are mandary to activate UART flashing support. 

You need gcc/libusb development packages installed before build and install stm8flash:

installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash.git 
cd stm8flash
make
sudo install -m0755 stm8flash /usr/bin/
```

for instance, here use baremetal blink.c as example:
```
sdcc -lstm8 -mstm8 blink.c
sudo stm8flash -cstlinkv2 -pstm8s208mb -w blink.ihx
```
or you can try examples with this repo:
```
make
make swim
```

## with USB/UART adapter or on board UART chip (no debugging support)

TODO, how to activate BSL and stm8gal

# Debugging with stm8-gdb
[stm8-binutils-gdb](https://stm8-binutils-gdb.sourceforge.io/) project implement the opensource GDB debugger for STM8.

Up to this tutorial written, the latest version is '2021-07-18', follow below instructions to build and install it, it will download binutils/gdb tarball automatically from upstream:

```
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm8-binutils-gdb/files/stm8-binutils-gdb-sources-2021-07-18.tar.gz/download -O
stm8-binutils-gdb-sources-2021-07-18.tar.gz
tar -xf stm8-binutils-gdb-sources-2021-07-18.tar.gz
cd stm8-binutils-gdb-sources
./patch_binutils.sh
./configure_binutils.sh
cd binutils-2.30
make
sudo make install
```

stm8-gdb use ELF binary format with debug symbols, you have to use below flags to build your source code:
```
--out-fmt-elf --all-callee-saves --debug --verbose --stack-auto --fverbose-asm  --float-reent --no-peep
```

For instance, we use above blink.c:
```
sdcc -lstm8 -mstm8 --out-fmt-elf --all-callee-saves --debug --verbose --stack-auto --fverbose-asm  --float-reent --no-peep blink.c
```

After compilation, the `blink.elf` will be generated.

**NOTE:** If you have multiple source files in your project, these flags should be applied to every source file when creating object code. otherwise, the final ELF binary will not have debug symbols embeded in.
